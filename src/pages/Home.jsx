        Iâ€™m on a journey to become a front-end web developer. I love building little projects, trying out new coding techniques, and sharing what I learn along the way. When Iâ€™m not at my desk, youâ€™ll find me reading, hiking through the mountains, or challenging myself on rock-climbing walls.
        <br /> <br />
        I started this blog to document my progress, keep myself accountable, and hopefully inspire anyone else whoâ€™s learning to code. Welcome to my corner of the internet, and thanks for stopping by!
